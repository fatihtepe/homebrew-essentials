[wikit](https://github.com/KorySchneider/wikit)

This one is a much smaller repo, and I love it. I have my terminal open all day via iTerm2, so being able to search Wikipedia is awesome. wikit allows you to do that from the terminal. You‚Äôd be surprised by how often I use this one on a day-to-day basis.

-installation
```
npm i wikit -g
```

-examples
```
wikit apple

wikit linux -b
```
